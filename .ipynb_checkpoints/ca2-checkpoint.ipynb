    "\n",
    "<h2>What Is the effect of mutation? Would it be any problem if we use only crossover?</h2>\n",
    "<p>The most important effect of mutation is to generate new chromosomes using random abilities and to prevent getting stuck in local maximums or at least lower probability of it. So without mutation, we simply don't reach the goal because there would be a kind of bias in chromosomes after tens or hundreds iterations.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "<h2>Mutation or crossover, which one is more effective? Which one increases accuracy faster?</h2>\n",

    "<h2>It's still possible to get stuch in local maxes though we use crossover and mutation. Why?</h2>\n",

    "    <p style=\"text-indent :2em;\"> 1. Increase probability of Pm and Pc.</p>\n",
